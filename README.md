# SwiftUI: Create a new color scheme 
## _step by step_

¡Hola mundo!

Lately I have been doing list of things that I think might be useful for other developers📱. This time I decided to write down a step by step of how we can create our own customized color palette or color scheme 🎨 for SwiftUI.

I'm not claiming this is the best or only way but it is definetly my favourite way to do so. You can read my [Dev.to post about it here](https://dev.to/silviaespanagil/step-by-step-customize-your-colors-in-swifui-o98)
